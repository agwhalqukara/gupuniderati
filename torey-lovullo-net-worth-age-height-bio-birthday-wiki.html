Salvatore Anthony “Torey” Lovullo (born July 25, 1965) is an American professional baseball manager for the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball (MLB), appointed November 4, 2016.</p><p>Altogether, Lovullo appeared in 303 MLB games, including 133 at second base, and 67 each at first base and third base. He batted .224 in 737 at bats, collecting 165 total hits, including 15 home runs, 60 runs batted in, 35 doubles and one triple. In Japan in 1999 he played in only 29 games and batted .197 with one home run and two runs batted in.</p><p>During his minor league managing career, Lovullo was named “Manager of the Year” in both the Carolina League (2004) and the Eastern League (2005). For the latter season, he also was named Double-A Manager of the Year by Baseball America. His nine-year (2002–10) win-loss record as a minor league manager is 661–609 (.520).</p><p>In 2009, the Indians changed their Triple-A affiliation from Buffalo to the Columbus (Ohio) Clippers of the International League. Lovullo had played for the Clippers in 1991–92 when the team was the Yankees’ top farm club. The Clippers were the International League champions in both seasons Lovullo played in Columbus, winning back-to-back Governors’ Cup trophies. In 2009, his only season as the Clippers’ manager, the team compiled a 57–85 (.401) record, but Lovullo was recruited by the Boston Red Sox to take over their Triple-A team, the Pawtucket Red Sox, for 2010. It was his first season in the Boston organization, although both Farrell (as pitching coach) and another former Cleveland farm system official, Mike Hazen (as director of player development), were playing key roles with the Red Sox. Lovullo’s 2010 PawSox finished 66–78 (.458) and out of the playoffs, fourth in the Northern Division of the International League.</p><p align=justify>During Lovullo’s playing career, he had spent all or parts of three seasons (1995; 1997–98) as a player for the Bisons and won two championships: one in the American Association and one in the International League. In 2003, he also had received the highest honor awarded to an alumnus of Buffalo baseball, as he was inducted into the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame, alongside his teammate from the 1997 and 1998 championship squads, Jeff Manto. In three campaigns (2006–08) as the Bisons’ manager, he led the club to two winning records, and compiled a mark of 214–212.
