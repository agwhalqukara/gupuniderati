Early in the film, Rango claims that <b>Rattlesnake Jake is his brother</b> when he is first brought up by the townspeople while making up his overblown heroic persona; thus, when Jake attacks the town, he uses this bold-faced lie to expose Rango as a phony in front of everyone and drive him out of town.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_the_villain_in_Rango></span><strong>Who is the villain in Rango?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b>The Honorable Mayor Marlon Carlton Tortoise John Lynch</b> is the true main antagonist of the film Rango.
