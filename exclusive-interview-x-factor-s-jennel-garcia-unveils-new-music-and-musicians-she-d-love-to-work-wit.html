style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><strong>Jennel Garcia</strong> is a&nbsp;talented 20-year old pop singer/songwriter from Rochester, Massachusetts. Sound familiar? &nbsp;You might recognize her from when she appeared&nbsp;on&nbsp;Season 2 of&nbsp;The X Factor USA. On the show she was&nbsp;part of the Young Adults category&nbsp;and was&nbsp;mentored by Demi Lovato, reaching 11th place!</p><p>Since being on The X Factor, Jennel has been busy getting ready to release her debut album. CelebMix recently caught up with&nbsp;her&nbsp;to talk more about&nbsp;the&nbsp;album, her favorite songs off of it, her style, her fans, what musicians she’d love to work with, and more.</p><p><strong>CelebMix:&nbsp;Many people know you from The X Factor’s second season, what’s the first step you took once you got off the show in order to continue your career?</strong></p><p><span><strong>Jennel</strong></span>: After The X Factor I was determined to get in the studio and get some original music out. &nbsp;I unfortunately lost everything I had worked on after the show, but I believe everything happens for a reason! &nbsp;So I pulled myself together, I started writing again, I went on a tour, recorded my first record and I’ve just been trying to connects with fans and build my support team. &nbsp;It hasn’t been easy, but everything I do is worth it.</p><p><strong>CelebMix: Do you think that The X Factor helped you gain experience for the career you’re now officially pursuing?</strong></p><p><span><strong>Jennel</strong></span>:&nbsp;The X Factor as for sure taught me so much. &nbsp;There’s things that no type of schooling could ever teach you the way The X Factor taught me things like it did just by me experiencing it hands on. Even after the show and continuing my career I’ve learned things that I never even thought were “things.” &nbsp;It’s a work in progress, I’m still learning something new everyday. &nbsp;Every day counts.</p><p><strong>CelebMix: Just this past September you released your first official music video for “The Only One.” How was the filming process like for you?</strong></p><p><span><strong>Jennel</strong></span>: The process of shooting a music video for “The Only One” was a dream. &nbsp;I walked into this building that so many inspirational celebrities had recently just shot videos in, like Annie Lennox’s video for “I Put A Spell On You” from 50 Shades of Grey and Sia’s video for “Chandelier” (which is my fave ever,) and it was just good vibes all around. &nbsp;There was an entire crew working on the set and everyone was there for me, so it just felt like the princess life! &nbsp;I loved it, I loved it, I loved it! &nbsp;I was exhausted by the end of the day, but it was one of the best experiences of my life.</p><p><strong>CelebMix: Did you have any input on how you wanted the video to be like? If so, which ideas were yours?</strong></p><p><span><strong>Jennel</strong></span>: Actually 90% of the video ideas were mine. &nbsp;I had ideas for the songs video since the day I wrote it which was when was around 17. &nbsp;The white room was my idea, everyone was a little skeptical about it, not knowing how it was going to look but I knew that it was going to be sick. &nbsp;It’s just a representation of my mind. &nbsp;It’s supposed to be my thoughts and me practicing what I’d say to the guy at this party that I eventually attend in the video. &nbsp;The party scene was a collaborative thought between me and the video director Ryan Turner. Then the band shot was a MUST because I live to stand behind a microphone and in front of a band. &nbsp;That was a given! As for the sets and my outfits and all, I put a lot of thought into that and it came out great so that’s something I’m extremely proud of myself for.</p><p><strong>CelebMix: What does the song mean to you, and did you write it?</strong></p><p><span><strong>Jennel</strong></span>: I actually did write the song all myself lyrically and melody wise. &nbsp;It was just something I was going through at the time with a guy and the relationship being so hot and cold all the time. &nbsp;It was a very quick writing process for me cause it was what I was feeling and it was natural. &nbsp;I had the voice memo of it on my phone for years before I showed it to anybody. &nbsp;It was just a simple acapella recording of me singing the song. &nbsp;I showed it to my producers at ZK Productions and they just took it and ran with it cause they believed in it and it was awesome. &nbsp;It was a perfect example of teamwork.</p><p><strong>CelebMix: Are you thinking of making another video for your latest single “Life Starts Now?” If so, do you have an idea of what the video should be like?</strong></p><p><span><strong>Jennel</strong></span>: I definitely want to shoot a video for “Life Starts Now!” &nbsp;I want something with just a bunch of my friends and young adults owning the night and living life to its fullest. &nbsp;I have too many ideas! &nbsp;But I want something wicked cool and fun. &nbsp;I’m totally excited for that project. &nbsp;That’s one of my main goals for this spring/summer.</p><p><strong>CelebMix: I heard you’re working on a new album, what would you describe the sound to be like?</strong></p><p><span><strong>Jennel</strong></span>: I’ve been writing for forever now. &nbsp;I really want to stay true to my colorful pop rock sound but I wanna add a bit of that 80’s vibe that’s really in right now. &nbsp;“Life Starts Now” kinda has that vibe and I love it because 80’s music is my favorite. &nbsp;This record I have done already, I was very strict with using ALL real instruments that were manually played and recorded but I think I may want to experiment a little more out side of the box the next time around. &nbsp;I haven’t fully decided on it all yet but I definitely want to change things up a little bit!</p><p><strong>CelebMix: Do you have a favorite song yet? If so, which would it be and why?</strong></p><p><span><strong>Jennel</strong></span>: I don’t really think I have a favorite song off of my record yet. &nbsp;They all mean a lot to me and I put my all into each and every one of them, writing and even singing wise. &nbsp;I got this song I did on there that was actually originally written for Paramore’s Riot album back in like 2007. &nbsp;It’s extremely relevant for that time era and the music that was hip back then and I’ve always wanted to do a song that’s really punchy like Paramore was then. &nbsp;So that was really cool for me. &nbsp;I sang the crap out of that song. &nbsp;So I’m really excited about that one and to eventually perform it.</p><p><strong>CelebMix: If you could feature one musician on your album, who would it be and why?</strong></p><p><span><strong>Jennel</strong></span>: One artist that would kill to sing with is Steven Tyler. &nbsp;But that’s just a dream. I would also love to do a song with like Jared Leto or Hayley Williams. &nbsp;I mean, I’m really always just honored to sing with anyone who loves to sing as much as I do. &nbsp;It’s always amazing to collaborate. &nbsp;Maybe one day Johnny Depp will play guitar on my record and even sing a little on it too. But that’s just a dream too!</p><p><strong>CelebMix: We have to admit, we love your style! Who would you say is your style icon or icons?</strong></p><p><span><strong>Jennel</strong></span>: Thank you! &nbsp;I wish I could tell you who my style icon is haha! &nbsp;I kinda just see something I like and I wear it. &nbsp;I always have an eye out for a cute shall and fringe-y stuff and&nbsp;things Stevie Nicks would wear. &nbsp;But my style goes from girly, to plain Jane to some really interesting get ups at times… So I guess I just like to play dress up!</p><p><strong>CelebMix: What are some of the most rewarding things a fan has told you when it came to your music? (If any, or multiple fans)</strong></p><p><span><strong>Jennel</strong></span>: It’s always rewarding when fans can relate to my music. &nbsp;Regardless of this crazy gypsy, traveling musician life I live, I’m still just a young girl who goes through things like everyone does. That’s what I write about and it’s always a good feeling when someone can relate because not only does it make them feel like there not alone, it makes me feel like I’m not alone. &nbsp;Like I’m not the only one who goes through things and feels certain things. &nbsp;It makes me feel closer to fans and I really like that.</p><p><strong>CelebMix: Do you have any advice for your fans who want to pursue a career in the music industry?</strong></p><p><span><strong>Jennel</strong></span>: Get ready, get set, and go go GO! &nbsp;Once your heart is in the music business, you can never get out. &nbsp;But your heart HAS to be in it for all the right reasons. &nbsp;Not for fame, not to be friends with celebrities, but for the love of music and creating art. &nbsp;It’s a hard industry, you have to be tough as nails! &nbsp;You have to be mentally prepared as well as having all your duckies in a row and get ready to constantly move forward no mater what. To me, a true musician never gives up. So you have to be ready for the long haul of ups and downs, successes and failures because it’s a constant roller coaster. &nbsp;But it’s also the most reward thing I could ever experience. &nbsp;So I guess I’d say all that, give them a hug and a pat on the back and say “GOODLUCK!!”</p><p><strong>If you love Jennel as much as we do, let us know why in the comments below or tweet us @<a href=#>CelebMix</a>!</strong></p><p><strong>Check out her latest single “Life Starts Now”:</strong></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ktq%2FAxKutop2nYsVussCcq6iqo2K3prrNnqNmn5GnsKqtjK6lr52ZocBuusSwZKynnpx6rbXFnmSsrJGnwbR5zaiuaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-to-do-a-lat-pulldown-benefits-technique.html>&#171;&nbsp;How To Do A Lat Pulldown | Benefits &amp;amp; Technique</a>
