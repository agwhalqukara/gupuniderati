id=sub-header>July 2024 · 6 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><strong>Seyi Tinubu is the only surviving son and one of the children of Asiwaju <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Bola Tinubu</a>, the reputable godfather and former governor of Lagos State, as well as the 2023 presidential candidate of APC ahead of the 2023 general elections.</strong></p><p>He is an industrious and hard-working entrepreneur and businessman. Like his father, many expected him to tow his father’s path and become a politician too, but he shocked them by choosing a different path. According to him, what has always driven him is hard work and persistence, and never letting plans that do not work out discourage him from holding on and pushing harder.</p><p>Seyi is said to be the love child from his father’s earlier relationship with his former partner Bunmi Oshonaike, an air hostess in her early days. He recently treated her to her 60th birthday grand celebration, and she is undoubtedly proud of the handsome and quite responsible father and husband he has turned out to be.</p><h2><strong>Seyi is the Love Child Between Bola Tinubu and Bunmi Oshonaike</strong></h2><p>He was born on the 15th of October 1985, which makes him 38 years old, and his zodiac sign is Libra. His mother is not really married to his father, but the two undoubtedly have a good relationship. He is the oldest of his siblings, and he spent most of his school years abroad. Though coming from an influential and well-grounded family, Seyi has made a name for himself and his family, doing what he loves doing best.</p><p>From his mother’s side, it is not known if Seyi has other siblings. However, he has three siblings through his father’s marriage to Oluremi Tinubu. His step-brother Babajide Tinubu died of a heart attack in 2017. His other siblings are Folashade Tinubu-Ojo, popularly known as Iyaloja, and Abibat Tinubu, the youngest in Tinubu’s family. His sister, Folashade, is married to Hon. Oyetunde Ojo, a member of Lagos State House of Assembly, while nothing much is known about his youngest sibling, Abibat.</p><h3><strong>He is Married to Layal Jade Tinubu</strong></h3><p>Seyi is happily married to the love of his life Layal Jade Tinubu, formally known as Layal Holm. The two got married in August of 2016 in Italy. His wife is half Lebanese and half Nigerian, and the two lovebirds have grown their family by having a couple of adorable little feet running here and there.</p><p>Born in London, Layal was brought up and schooled there. She attended the University of Surrey, where she studied Entrepreneurship and Business. Seyi’s wife is a Boss of her own as she owns a children’s Toy shop call Tots Toys and is also the co-founder of the famous Noella Foundation. Seyi and Layal are proud parents to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>two beautiful children</a>.</p><h3><strong>Seyi Acquired Sound Education Which Paved The Way For His Tremendous Achievements</strong></h3><p>Seyi started by attending St. Saviour’s school in Lagos before moving to the UK, where he attended Holmewood House school for his primary education and then went ahead to Milton Abbey before enrolling at Lincoln University. However, he later attended the University of Maryland in Baltimore, where he obtained a B.A from 2004-2008. In 2010, he then proceeded to the University of Buckingham, where he graduated with (LLB), Bachelor of Law.</p><p>Upon graduation, he returned to Nigeria and attended law school before being called to bar in 2013. While in law school, he took up a position as an intern with Oando Plc. He has also bagged a master’s degree from the University of Buckingham in Corporate and Commercial Law. Sadly, in October of 2017, Seyi’s brother, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Babajide</a>, died suddenly in London after a heart attack. According to people’s opinion, Babajide would have been the heir to carry on the political dreams of their father as Seyi is more interested in business than he is in politics.</p><p>But some time in the past, some people called Free Lagos Movement started rumors that said that Bola Tinubu was preparing his son Seyi to become governor of Lagos State come 2023.&nbsp;However, sooner than expected, the rumors died down because of a lack of substance to back it up, and it also had no political backings. Interestingly, Seyi’s stepmother, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Oluremi Tinubu</a>, used to be a women leader in Lagos before moving up the ladder to became a Nigerian senator; she held the senate seat for eight years.</p><h2><strong>A Look At His Biggest Accomplishments In Business</strong></h2><p>Seyi has many accomplishments to his credit. One of his major business achievements is that he is an Ambassador, CEO, and founder of Loatsad Promomedia Ltd, which has his friend Aderenrele Olusoga as the Managing Director. It is an outdoor advertising company that develops great solutions for brands that want to be successful.</p><p>Promomedia places world-class billboards for its clients in Nigeria and beyond, focusing on beauty, originality, uniqueness, and ambiance. His sound legal acumen makes him very much sought-after. Since the inception of the company years ago, he has overseen and completed over 1000 advertising transactions, representing his company well and making huge wealth both for himself and his clients in the process.</p><p>He also established Noella Foundation, which happens to be an umbrella foundation for the Seyi Tinubu Empowerment Programme, also known as (STEP). This foundation aims to empower and equip Nigerian youths through job creation, skill development, and seed funding; it generally promotes nation-building through human capital development.</p><p>Seyi’s love and passion for nation-building and helping the underprivileged gave birth to TELD NGO, founded in 2005. The NGO strives to provide better life quality for the poor and underprivileged, and youths in Nigeria. TELD provides school fees for children and youths to enable them to attend boarding school and other mentoring programs. He is also the coordinator of the Bola Tinubu Foundation, which was founded in 2012. The foundation focuses on training, education, and hunger alleviation among Nigerians.</p><p>He organized, led, and coordinated an outreach held in December of 2013, where 3000 bags of rice and cooking oil were distributed among the people. There’s also the Youth Musical Fiesta, which his mother, senator Oluremi, began in June of 2012, where youths and children from 7- 18 years of age from various church singing groups perform and compete; it holds annually.</p><h3><strong>At 38, Seyi Tinubu Has Got Several Accolades</strong></h3><p>For his competence and great achievements at such young age, Seyi has been rewarded with the following awards;</p><ul><li>He received Honouree of the Most Influential People Of African Decent under 40 in 2019.</li><li>Special Recognition award by JustU Magazine at the Award Night held by JustU, 2019.</li><li>He also received Europe Business Assembly Award (EBA) for Best Enterprise and Manager of the Year 2019.</li><li>The Excellence Award in Media Enterprise by the Sapoi Club in 2019.</li><li>Business Person of the year, Entrepreneur Africa Award 2019.</li><li>Patron of Man o’ War Lagos in 2019.</li><li>Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award at the Leadership Excellence Awards in 2017.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK5706uYnKGenHq1tMRmo6KelWKur7CMmpqcp52luaq%2Fx6acp6yjYrynedKesKJlpJ67tq7UZpmopJFiwaq61JusrGWjpLtw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./wwe-rumors-on-brock-lesnar-s-schedule-judgment-day-split-and-ronda-rousey-s-future-news-scores.html>&#171;&nbsp;WWE Rumors on Brock Lesnar's Schedule, Judgment Day Split and Ronda Rousey's Future | News, Scores,</a>
